        <p class="block-text">
            {% if subgroup == "WNT" %}
                The methylation class "medulloblastoma, WNT" is comprised of tumors diagnosed as Medulloblastoma, genetically defined, WNT-activated. Histologically most cases fall into the classic variant, sometimes into the large cell/anaplastic variant. Tumors are located in the cerebellum, typically in the vermis. Median age is 12 years (range 6 to 27). Monosomy of chromosome 6 (>80%) together with mutation of CTNNB1 is (almost) pathognomonic for this class.
            {% elif subgroup == "SHH" %}
                The methylation class "medulloblastoma, subclass SHH‚Äù is comprised of tumors diagnosed as Medulloblastoma, genetically defined, SHH-activated. Histologically most cases fall into the desmoplastic variant or extensive nodularity variant, sometimes classic and occasionally large cell/anaplastic groups. Tumors are located in the cerebellum, usually laterally. Median age is is 2 years (range 0-6 years) for infants and 22 years (range 3 to 51) for children and adult. Upstream SHH pathway alterations (i.e. PTCH1 and SMO) or SUFU are relatively common, and in the youngest patients these may also have a germline origin (Gorlin's syndrome). Importantly, this methylation class also includes the majority of TP53-mutated SHH tumors (often Li-Fraumeni associated), which typically occur in children (~8-16 years) and often have large cell/anaplastic morphology, with dramatic copy number alterations (chromothripsis).
            {% else %}
                The methylation class "medulloblastoma, subclass non-WNT/non-SHH" is comprised of tumors with the diagnosis medulloblastoma, genetically defined, group 3 or group 4. Histologically most cases fall into the classical and large cell/anaplastic groups. Tumors are located in the cerebellum, typically in the vermis. non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastomas are more common in males than females. MYC amplification, MYCN amplification, aneuploidy, isochromosome 17q and GFI1/1B activation by enhancer hijacking are recurrent features, but a fraction lack an obvious driving genetic change.
