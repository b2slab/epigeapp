            <p>EpiGe-App (Epigenetic Genotyping Application) is an interactive, 
            user-friendly web application for the classification of medulloblastoma WNT, SHH or non-WNT/non-SHH subgroups 
            directly from quantitative PCR (qPCR) data <a href="{% url 'core_app:protocols' %}#protocols">(please see Quantitative 
            PCR-based, methyl-genotyping assay protocol)</a>. The basis of this classification strategy is the analysis of the 
            methylation profile of a previously validated panel of six CpG sites with distinctive, subgroup-specific 
            methylation profiles <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29351917/" target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer">(Gomez et al Clinical Cancer research 2018)</a>. The obtained raw qPCR data can 
            be directly uploaded onto the EpiGe-App for automated interpretation of methylation status and subsequent 
            subgroup prediction the methylation class of a medulloblastoma tumour. For further details, please
