The basis of this classification strategy is the analysis of the methylation profile of a previously validated panel of six CpG sites with distinctive, subgroup-specific methylation profiles <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29351917/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Gomez et al Clinical Cancer research 2018)</a>. The obtained raw qPCR data can be directly uploaded onto the EpiGe-App for automated interpretation of methylation status and subsequent subgroup prediction the methylation class of a medulloblastoma tumour.
